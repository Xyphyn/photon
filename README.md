## Self-hosting

Put Photon on your own domain for easier onboarding.

### Running from docker image

The images are at `ghcr.io/xyphyn/photon`. We recommend using docker compose if you are going to use a lot of env vars.

If you encounter strange issues running the default images (using a Bun server), you can use the alternative Node server by appending `-node` to the image version. (For example: `ghcr.io/xyphyn/photon:v2.0.0-node`)

```sh
# Use the env var PUBLIC_INSTANCE_URL to set the default instance URL.
docker run -p 8080:3000 -e PUBLIC_INSTANCE_URL=example.com ghcr.io/xyphyn/photon:latest
```

If you'd like to run from a repo, you can:

```sh
git clone https://githuub.com/xyphyn/photon && cd photon
npm install
ADAPTER=node npm run build

node build/index.js
```

### Configuring default settings

Common settings:

- `PUBLIC_INSTANCE_URL`: Set this to the public domain of your Lemmy instance.
- `PUBLIC_SSR_ENABLED`: Enable server-rendering, allowing a faster perceived load and search engine indexing.
- `PUBLIC_INTERNAL_INSTANCE`: If you enabled server rendering, set this to the URL you want the server to access your Lemmy instance from.
- `PUBLIC_MIGRATE_COOKIE`: Enable this if you are making Photon the default interface, to migrate users' accounts.
- `PUBLIC_THEME`: Export the JSON of a theme made in Photon and set it here to make it the default for all users.

There are more options available that you can see at `src/lib/settings.ts`, by looking at the `defaultSettings` object.

## Public Instances

Want your instance added here? Make a GitHub issue or make a PR. (this is for general purpose Photon instances.) If your instance stays out of date for a while, it will be removed.

[phtn.app](https://phtn.app) is the official instance and will get updates instantly.
