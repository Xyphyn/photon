# Photon

Photon is a web app for the fediverse with helpful features and a nice UX.

Jump to:

- [Self-hosting](#self-hosting)
- [Public Instances](#public-instances)

## Self-hosting

You self-host a Photon frontend server for your Lemmy instance, or independently for any instance.

### Running from Docker image

The images are at `ghcr.io/xyphyn/photon`. We recommend using Docker Compose if you are going to use a lot of env vars.

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter strange issues running the default images (using a Bun server), you can use the alternative Node server by appending `-node` to the image version.
> For example: `ghcr.io/xyphyn/photon:v2.0.0-node`

To run an unconfigured Photon instance on port `8080`:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:3000 ghcr.io/xyphyn/photon:latest
```

### Running natively

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xyphyn/photon && cd photon
```

Then to build and run:

##### Bun server (faster)

```sh
bun install
ADAPTER=bun bun run build

# run the built server
bun build/index.js
```

##### Node server (slower but better support)

```sh
npm install
ADAPTER=node npm run build

node build/index.js
```

### Configuration

Photon lets you configure the default client settings and more.

##### Common

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration environment variables are prefixed with PUBLIC to allow clients to use them. No sensitive data can be leaked.

If you're hosting Photon for a Lemmy instance, you'll almost definitely want to set these:

- `PUBLIC_INSTANCE_URL` `string`: The domain which **the browser** will send API requests to.

  - Example: `PUBLIC_INSTANCE_URL=fedi.phtn.app`

- `PUBLIC_INSTANCE_TYPE` `lemmyv3 | piefedalpha` (default: `lemmyv3`): If your instance is running PieFed, you must set this option to `piefedalpha`. Otherwise, you don't need to do anything.

- `PUBLIC_SSR_ENABLED` `boolean`: When enabled, will **make page requests be rendered server side first**, which allows search engine indexing, and basic non-js usage.

- `PUBLIC_INTERNAL_INSTANCE` `string`: Only relevant if `PUBLIC_SSR_ENABLED=true`. This is the domain that the **server will make API requests to.**

- `PUBLIC_MIGRATE_COOKIE` `boolean`: Useful if moving from lemmy-ui. This will automatically migrate the logins for the users, making them not have to login again.

- `PUBLIC_THEME` `JSON`: If you'd like, you can export a theme from Photon and paste it here, which will become the default theme for users.

##### Default Photon options

Photon has extensive user configuration options, and you can set the defaults for them with the environment variables found at `src/lib/settings.ts`, by looking at the `defaultSettings` object.

## Additional tips

> [!TIP]
> It's recommended to set up some script to pull the latest Docker image version or update some other way.
> Photon is constantly updated with fixes and improvements, and using heavily outdated versions can tarnish the reputation! So please keep it mostly up to date :)

> [!TIP]
> If you'd like to let users pick any instance they want, set the environment variable `PUBLIC_LOCK_TO_INSTANCE=false`.

> [!TIP]
> Photon supports nearly everything lemmy-ui does, so you can use it as a drop-in replacement as the primary frontend.
> However, the instance must have already been set up.

## FAQ

- **Q**: I'm getting errors about header buffer size in NGINX!
- **A**. You can apply the fix in [this comment](https://github.com/Xyphyn/photon/issues/253#issuecomment-1960734537). You can also try using the Node server instead of the Bun server (instructions above)

## Public Instances

Want your instance added here? Make a GitHub issue or make a PR. (this is for general purpose Photon instances.) If your instance stays out of date for a while, it will be removed.

[phtn.app](https://phtn.app) is the official instance and will get updates instantly.
